# Phase 1 PoC Test Report

**Date**: 2025-12-08 19:47:45
**Test Suite**: DeepSeek Yjs Operations Generation
**Test Cases**: 5 (TC1-TC5)

## Test Execution

```
Test Environment:
- Server: http://localhost:3001
- Model: deepseek-chat
- Temperature: 0.3
- Max Tokens: 2000
```

## Results

**Status**: ❌ FAILED

The PoC did not meet the success criteria. One or more metrics failed:
- Text accuracy <95%
- Format preservation <90%
- Operation consistency <90%
- Response time >3s

### Recommendation

❌ **Switch to Fallback Strategy (方案 C)**

Use hybrid approach:
1. AI returns HTML or Token JSON format
2. Frontend performs Token Diff
3. Generate Yjs operations from diff results

This approach provides fallback reliability while maintaining format preservation.

### Next Steps

1. Modify DeepSeek system prompt for JSON/HTML output
2. Implement Token Diff on frontend
3. Convert diff results to Yjs operations
4. Test end-to-end workflow

## Detailed Logs
